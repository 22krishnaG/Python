    "Q1. Explain Class and Object with respect to Object-Oriented Programming. Give a suitable example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: n object-oriented programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint or a template that defines the structure and behavior of objects. It encapsulates data (attributes) and functions (methods) that are related to a specific concept or entity. Objects, on the other hand, are instances of a class. They represent individual entities created from the class blueprint, and each object can have its own unique data and behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "A class provides a way to create multiple objects with similar characteristics and behavior. It defines the common attributes and methods that objects of that class will have. Objects, on the other hand, are created based on the class, and they can access and modify the attributes and behavior defined by the class.\n",

    "\n",
    "Ans- The four pillars of object-oriented programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the process of bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) together within a class. It involves hiding the internal details and providing an interface to interact with the object. Encapsulation helps in achieving data abstraction, data hiding, and code modularity.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Inheritance: Inheritance allows classes to inherit attributes and methods from other classes. It enables the creation of hierarchical relationships between classes, where a child class inherits the properties of a parent class. This promotes code reuse, extensibility, and the organization of related classes into a hierarchical structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Polymorphism: Polymorphism means the ability of an object to take on many forms. It allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. Polymorphism enables the use of a single interface to represent different types of objects. This helps in achieving code flexibility, reusability, and the implementation of dynamic behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Abstraction: Abstraction involves representing complex real-world entities using simplified models in the form of classes and objects. It focuses on defining the essential characteristics and behavior of an object, while hiding the irrelevant details. Abstraction helps in managing complexity, providing a clear interface for interaction, and promoting code maintainability.\n",

    "These four pillars of OOP (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction) provide the foundation for creating modular, flexible, and reusable code, enabling developers to model and solve complex problems efficiently."

    "Q4. Why self is used in OOPs?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans- n object-oriented programming (OOP), the self parameter is used to refer to the instance of a class within its methods. It acts as a reference to the current object being operated upon. It is a convention in Python to use the name self, although you can choose any valid name for the first parameter in a method.\n",
    "\n",
    "The use of self in OOP is important for the following reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "Accessing Object Attributes: self allows methods within a class to access and manipulate the object's attributes. By using self.attribute_name, you can refer to the specific instance variable of the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Differentiating Between Local and Instance Variables: In a method, if you have a local variable and an instance variable with the same name, using self helps distinguish between them. It allows you to explicitly reference the instance variable, ensuring you are working with the object's attribute rather than a local variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Calling Other Class Methods: self is necessary to call other methods within the class. When invoking a method, you need to specify the instance upon which the method should operate. Using self.method_name() ensures that the method is called on the current object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating and Manipulating Multiple Objects: self allows you to create multiple instances of a class, and each object will have its own set of attributes and behavior. self helps differentiate between the instance variables of different objects, enabling you to work with the correct object's data."

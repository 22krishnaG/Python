    "Q1. Which function is used to open a file? What are the different modes of opening a file? Explain each mode of file opening.\n",
    "Ans-\n",
    "In Python, the open() function is used to open a file. It takes the file path and the mode as arguments and returns a file object that can be used to read, write, or manipulate the contents of the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The different modes of opening a file in Python are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "'r' (Read mode): This is the default mode. It is used to open a file for reading. If the file does not exist, it will raise a FileNotFoundError exception. The file pointer is positioned at the beginning of the file, and you can only read the contents of the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "'w' (Write mode): This mode is used to open a file for writing. If the file exists, it will be truncated (i.e., all existing contents will be deleted) before writing. If the file does not exist, a new file will be created. The file pointer is positioned at the beginning of the file, and you can write new content to the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "'a' (Append mode): This mode is used to open a file for appending. If the file exists, the file pointer is positioned at the end of the file, and you can append new content to the existing contents. If the file does not exist, a new file will be created.\n",
    "\n",
    "'x' (Exclusive creation mode): This mode is used to open a file exclusively for writing. It creates a new file but raises a FileExistsError if the file already exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "'b' (Binary mode): This mode is used in conjunction with other modes to specify binary file handling. For example, 'rb' is used for reading a binary file, 'wb' for writing a binary file, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "'t' (Text mode): This is the default mode and is used to handle text files. It is not explicitly specified in the mode string but is assumed when no other mode is specified.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example that demonstrates opening a file in different modes:"

The file objects file1, file2, file3, file4, file5, and file6 can then be used to perform operations on the respective files based on their modes.\n",

    "It's important to note that when you open a file using the open() function, it's recommended to close the file using the close() method of the file object after you have finished working with it.

    "Q2. Why close() function is used? Why is it important to close a file?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans- The close() function is used to close a file that has been opened using the open() function in Python. It is important to close a file after you have finished working with it for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "Resource Management: When a file is opened, the operating system allocates certain resources to handle the file operations. This includes memory space, file handles, and other system resources. By closing the file, you release these resources back to the operating system, ensuring efficient resource management.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Integrity: Closing a file ensures that all the data you have written or read from the file is properly flushed and saved to the underlying storage. If you do not close the file and terminate the program abruptly, there is a chance that the data may not be saved, leading to data loss or corrupted files.\n",
    "\n",
    "File Locking: In some cases, when a file is open, it may be locked by the operating system or other processes, preventing other programs or processes from accessing or modifying it. By closing the file, you release the file lock, allowing other processes to access the file if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "System Limits: Operating systems have limits on the number of files that can be simultaneously open by a program or a user. If you do not close files after using them, you may reach these limits, preventing you from opening new files or causing issues with other programs or processes running on the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure proper file handling and prevent resource leaks, it is good practice to close a file after you have finished reading from or writing to it. You can close a file by calling the close() method on the file object, like this:"
